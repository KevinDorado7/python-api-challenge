Repository for the challenge #6 Python-API-Challenge

In this deliverable, I will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities at varying distances from the equator. I will use the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

To fulfill the second requirement, I will compute the linear regression for each relationship. I will separate the plots into the Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and the Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude).

To complete this activity, I have used resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code's functionality. Additionally, I mostly used ChatGPT for fixing errors with the scatter plots and linear regression functions.
